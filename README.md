# DotCleanPlus
Clean up MacOS artifacts from the device.

## How it works
Removes all the macOS artifacts: .DS_Store, ._* files, .Trashes, .Spotlight-V100, and .fseventsd
Searches recursively through all directories, including hidden ones
Shows output as a filecount, and writes the session to a file called `removed_log.txt`

## Installation and usage

Place the entire `DotCleanPlus` folder inside the `App` folder in your SD Card.  Then, to the Apps menu on your Miyoo Mini/Plus running OnionOS, and run the DotCleanPlus app.
